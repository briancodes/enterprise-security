## Same-origin Policy (SOP)

- default policy (irrespective of CORS)
- mechanism controlled by the server via headers, and enforced by the client e.g. Chrome Browser
- optionally enforced e.g. Postman doesn't enforce
- applies to `XHR` and `fetch`
- doesn't apply to `<script src="">` or `<link rel="stylesheet" href="">`

Ref: https://medium.com/@baphemot/understanding-cors-18ad6b478e2b

#### Origin: 

- The `origin` is all three of the following together:
    1. [`URI scheme/protocol`]https://
    1. [`sub-domain/host/domain`]example.com
    1. [`port`] :443

Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy

#### Browsers

- `same-origin policy` isolates the client-server from other isolated browser tabs
- Isolated tabs cannot utilize resourses e.g memory, localStorage, cookies
    - localStorage works accross tabs that are of the same-origin 
    - cookies are attached to an origin, accross tabs


#### Blocked Response

Cross-origin requests (fetch, XHRHttpRequest) can be made, but browser will block response 

> Error: No Acces-Control-Allow-Origin header is present on requested resource

It's the browser that blocks the response - by checking the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header

## Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Used by the requested server to relax the SOP enforced by browsers

Server running on `8081` in cross site request from `8080` might set: 

```javascript
app.use(cors({origin: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'}))
```
`Response Headers` would then include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://127.0.0.1:8080`, and browser would allow the response to be returned

#### Credentials Include

Making a cross origin request (fetch) does not send cookies by default. To send cookies requires the `credentials: include` header

- https://javascript.info/fetch-crossorigin#credentials

```javascript
fetch('http://another.com', {
  credentials: "include"
});
```
This will result in a `pre-flight` request

> If the server agrees to accept the request with credentials, it should add a header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` to the response, in addition to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

> `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is prohibited from using a star `*` for requests with credentials. Like shown above, it must provide the exact origin there. Thatâ€™s an additional safety measure, to ensure that the server really knows who it trusts to make such requests. 

## Content Security Policy

Needs to be implemented by the server, otherwise it's off by default

A good starting point is from 
- https://content-security-policy.com/

```html
default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
```

Node: `helmet-csp`. Adds `Content-Security-Policy` headers directing the browser to block inline-script/styes from running, and also cross-origin images, styles, scripts etc respones from being read

> inline refers to `<script>console.log('inline')</script>` and `<style>body {margin: 0;}</style>`

```javascript
app.use(csp({
    directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"], 
        // any inline is considered "unsafe", can allow with
        // styleSrc/scriptSrc: ["'unsafe-inline'"] 
        // inline disabled, allow <link href> from self and cross origin
        styleSrc: ["'self'", "'http://127.0.0.1:8081'"]
        // inline disabled, allow <script src> from self and cross origin
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'http://127.0.0.1:8081'"]
    }
}))

// Response Header: 
// Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'http://12..
```

Loading a cross origin styles without the orign domain in `styleSrc` would result in: 

> Error: Refused to apply inline-style...violates CSP directive `default-src 'self'`. Note: `style-src` was not explicitly used so fallback to `default-src`

> Network Tab for cross-origin css/js files: `Blocked (CSP)`

#### CSP: Allow Inline Without `unsafe-inline`

- hash sha
 - inline script generate at hash, add this to `scriptSrc`
- nonce
 - add `nonce-3534535` to the script tag and `script-src`
 - `Content-Security-Policy: script-src nonce-xxx;`

## Subresource Integrity

```html
<script 
    src="https://example.com/example-framework.js"
    integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6+"
    crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

> For subresource-integrity verification of a resource served from an origin other than the document in which it's embedded, browsers additionally check the resource using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), to ensure the origin serving the resource allows it to be shared with the requesting origin. Therefore, the resource must be served with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header that allows the resource to be shared with the requesting origin

#### Angular Subresource Integrity

`ng build --subresource-integrity`

```html
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="runtime.js"
  integrity="sha384-l2idrIRRBrjHbp+jErEfqKMlALJ8XhHO2xWq/3wCMAE2uO8I7Wv+yu2yKsG+"
  crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```
